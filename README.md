# svelteInk
A webapp aiming at making the use of imagegick gm easier 

The gm librairie is awesome and powerful
Yet it is quite hard to get in, especially for front-end fellows

This web app will help in term of accessing gm doc (see the script folder). It should also permit to create pipeline (rotate,thresold,
...) on the fly. Which would be cool because pandas.
