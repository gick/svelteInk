-treedepth <value>
tree depth for the color reduction algorithm
Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A value of zero or one causes the
use of an optimal tree depth for the color reduction algorithm
An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source image
with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of memory. However,
the default depth is inappropriate for some images. To assure the best
representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this parameter. Refer toquantize
[quantize.html] for more details.
The -colors or -monochrome option, or writing to an image format which requires
color reduction, is required for this option to take effect.
