-normalize
transform image to span the full range of color values
This is a contrast enhancement technique based on the image histogram.
When computing the contrast enhancement values, the histogram edges are
truncated so that the majority of the image pixels are considered in the
constrast enhancement, and outliers (e.g. random noise or minute details) are
ignored. The default is that 0.1 percent of the histogram entries are ignored.
The percentage of the histogram to ignore may be specified by using the -set
option with thehistogram-threshold parameter similar to -set histogram-threshold
0.01 to specify 0.01 percent. Use 0 percent to use the entire histogram, with
possibly diminished contrast enhancement.
