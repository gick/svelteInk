-repage <width>x<height>+xoff+yoff[!]
Adjust image page offsets
Adjust the current image page canvas and position based on a relative page
specification. This option may be used to change the location of a subframe
(e.g. part of an animation) prior to composition. If the geometry specification
is absolute (includes a '!'), then the offset adjustment is absolute and there
is no adjustment to page width and height, otherwise the page width and height
values are also adjusted based on the current image dimensions. Use +repage to
set the image page offsets to default.
