-shear <x degrees>x<y degrees>
shear the image along the X or Y axis
Use the specified positive or negative shear angle.
Shearing slides one edge of an image along the X or Y axis, creating a
parallelogram. An X direction shear slides an edge along the X axis, while a Y
direction shear slides an edge along the Y axis. The amount of the shear is
controlled by a shear angle. For X direction shears,x degrees is measured
relative to the Y axis, and similarly, for Y direction shears y degrees is
measured relative to the X axis.
Empty triangles left over from shearing the image are filled with the color
defined as background (class backgroundColor). The color is specified using the
format described under the-fill option.
