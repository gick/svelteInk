-extent <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>
composite image on background color canvas image
This option composites the image on a new background color (-background) canvas
image of size <width>x<height>. The existing image content is composited at the
position specified by geometry x and y offset and/or desired gravity (-gravity)
using the current image compose (-compose) method. Image content which falls
outside the bounds of the new image dimensions is discarded.
For example, this command creates a thumbnail of an image, and centers it on a
red color backdrop image, offsetting the canvas ten pixels to the left and five
pixels up, with respect to the thumbnail:

gm convert infile.jpg -thumbnail 120x80 -background red -gravity center \
-extent 140x100-10-5 outfile.jpg



This command reduces or expands a JPEG image to fit on an 800x600 display:

gm convert -size 800x600 input.jpg \
-resize 800x600 -background black \
-compose Copy -gravity center \
-extent 800x600 \
-quality 92 output.jpg



If the aspect ratio of the input image isn't exactly 4:3, then the image is
centered on an 800x600 black canvas.
