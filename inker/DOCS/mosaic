-mosaic
create a mosaic from an image or an image sequence
The -mosaic option provides a flexible way to composite one or more images onto
a solid-color canvas image. It works similar to-flatten except that a base
canvas image is automatically created with a suitable size given the image size,
page dimensions, and page offsets of images to be composited. The color of the
base canvas image may be set via the -background option. The default canvas
color is 'white', but 'black' or 'transparent' may be more suitable depending on
the composition algorithm requested.
The -compose option may be used to specify the composition algorithm to use when
compositing the subsequent image on the base canvas.
The -page option can be used to establish the dimensions of the mosaic and to
position the subsequent image within the mosaic. If the-page argument does not
specify width and height, then the canvas dimensions are evaluated based on the
image sizes and offsets.
The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option. If the
-mosaic option appears after all of the input images, all images are included in
the mosaic.
The following is an example of composing an image based on red, green, and blue
layers extracted from a sequence of images and pasted on the canvas image at
specified offsets:

gm convert -background black \
-compose CopyRed   -page +0-100 red.png \
-compose CopyGreen -page +0+40  green.png \
-compose CopyBlue  -page +0+180 blue.png \
