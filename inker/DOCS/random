-random-threshold <channeltype> <LOWxHIGH>
random threshold the image
The channel or channels specified in the <channeltype> argument are reduced to
binary, using an random-threshold method. The choices forchanneltype are All,
Intensity, Red,Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow,Black, and Opacity
When channeltype is "All", the color samples are thresholded into a graylevel
and then that gray level is stored in the three color channels. Separately, the
opacity channel is thresholded into a bilevel opacity value which is stored in
the opacity channel. For each pixel, a new random number is used to establish
the threshold to be used. The threshold never exceeds the specified maximum
(HIGH) and is never less than the specified minimum (LOW).
When channeltype is "intensity", only the color samples are thresholded. When
channeltype is "opacity" or "matte", only the opacity channel is thresholded.
The other named channels only threshold the associated channel.
