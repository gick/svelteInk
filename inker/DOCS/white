-white-threshold
red[,green][,blue][,opacity]
pixels above the threshold become white
Use -white-threshold to set pixels with values above the specified threshold to
maximum value (white). If only one value is supplied, or the red, green, and
blue values are identical, then intensity thresholding is used. If the color
threshold values are not identical then channel-based thresholding is used, and
color distortion will occur. Specify a negative value (e.g. -1) if you want a
channel to be ignored but you do want to threshold a channel later in the list.
If a percent (%) symbol is appended, then the values are treated as a percentage
of maximum range.
