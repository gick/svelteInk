-colors <value>
preferred number of colors in the image
The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request, but
never more. Note, this is a color reduction option. Images with less unique
colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate or unused colors
removed. The ordering of an existing color palette may be altered. When
converting an image from color to grayscale, convert the image to the gray
colorspace before reducing the number of colors since doing so is most
efficient. Refer to <a href="quantize.html">quantize for more details.
Note, options -dither, -colorspace, and -treedepthaffect the color reduction
algorithm.
