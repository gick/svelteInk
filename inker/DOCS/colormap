-colormap <type>
define the colormap type
Choose between shared or private.
This option only applies when the default X server visual is PseudoColoror
GRAYScale. Refer to -visual for more details. By default, a shared colormap is
allocated. The image shares colors with other X clients. Some image colors could
be approximated, therefore your image may look very different than intended.
Choose Private and the image colors appear exactly as they are defined. However,
other clients may go technicolor when the image colormap is installed.
