-noise <radius|type>
add or reduce noise in an image
The principal function of noise peak elimination filter is to smooth the objects
within an image without losing edge information and without creating undesired
structures. The central idea of the algorithm is to replace a pixel with its
next neighbor in value within a pixel window, if this pixel has been found to be
noise. A pixel is defined as noise if and only if this pixel is a maximum or
minimum within the pixel window.
Use radius to specify the width of the neighborhood.
Use +noise followed by a noise type to add noise to an image. The noise added
modulates the existing image pixels. Choose from these noise types:

Uniform
Gaussian
Multiplicative
Impulse
Laplacian
Poisson
Random (uniform distribution)
