-level <black_point>{,<gamma>}{
,<white_point>}{%}
adjust the level of image contrast
Give one, two or three values delimited with commas: black-point, gamma,
white-point (e.g. 10,1.0,250 or 2%,0.5,98%). The black and white points range
from 0 to MaxRGB or from 0 to 100%; if the white point is omitted it is set to
MaxRGB-black_point. If a "%" sign is present anywhere in the string, the black
and white points are percentages of MaxRGB. Gamma is an exponent that ranges
from 0.1 to 10.; if it is omitted, the default of 1.0 (no gamma correction) is
assumed. This interface works similar to Photoshop's
"Image->Adjustments->Levels..." "Input Levels" interface.
