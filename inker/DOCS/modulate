-modulate brightness[,saturation[,hue]]
vary the brightness, saturation, and hue of an image
Specify the percent change in brightness, color saturation, and hue separated by
commas. Default argument values are 100 percent, resulting in no change. For
example, to increase the color brightness by 20% and decrease the color
saturation by 10% and leave the hue unchanged, use: -modulate 120,90.
Hue is the percentage of absolute rotation from the current position. For
example 50 results in a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees, 150 results in
a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees, with 0 and 200 both resulting in a rotation
of 180 degrees.
