size and location of an image canvas
Use this option to specify the dimensions of thePostScript page in dots per inch
or a TEXT page in pixels. The choices for a PostScript page are:

For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g. A4, Ledger, etc.).
Otherwise, -page behaves much like-geometry (e.g. -page letter+43+43>).
This option is also used to place subimages when writing to a multi-image format
that supports offsets, such as GIF89 and MNG. When used for this purpose the
offsets are always measured from the top left corner of the canvas and are not
affected by the -gravityoption. To position a GIF or MNG image, use -page
{+-}<x>{+-}<y>(e.g. -page +100+200). When writing to a MNG file, a -pageoption
appearing ahead of the first image in the sequence with nonzero width and height
defines the width and height values that are written in the MHDR chunk.
Otherwise, the MNG width and height are computed from the bounding box that
contains all images in the sequence. When writing a GIF89 file, only the
bounding box method is used to determine its dimensions.
For a PostScript page, the image is sized as in -geometry and positioned
relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by {+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>
. Use-page 612x792>, for example, to center the image within the page. If the
image size exceeds the PostScript page, it is reduced to fit the page. The
default gravity for the -pageoption is NorthWest, i.e., positive x andy offset
are measured rightward and downward from the top left corner of the page, unless
the -gravity option is present with a value other than NorthWest.
The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.
This option is used in concert with -density.
Use +page to remove the page settings for an image.
