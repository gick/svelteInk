-profile <filename>
add ICM, IPTC, or generic profile to image
-profile filename adds an ICM (ICC color management), IPTC (newswire
information), or a generic (including Exif) profile to the image.
Use +profile icm, +profile iptc, or+profile profile_name to remove the
respective profile. Multiple profiles may be listed, separated by commas.
Profiles may be excluded from subsequent listed matches by preceding their name
with an exclamation point. For example, +profile '!icm,*' strips all profiles
except for the ICM profile. Use identify -verbose to find out what profiles are
in the image file. Use+profile "*" to remove all profiles.
Writing the image to a format that does not support profiles will of course also
cause all profiles to be removed. The JPEG and PNG formats will store any
profiles that have been read and not removed. In JPEG they are stored in APP1
markers, and in PNG they are stored as hex-coded binary in compressed zTXt
chunks, except for the iCC chunk which is stored in the iCCP chunk.
To extract a profile, the -profile option is not used. Instead, simply write the
file to an image format such as APP1, 8BIM, ICM, or IPTC.
For example, to extract the Exif data (which is stored in JPEG files in the APP1
profile), use

gm convert cockatoo.jpg exifdata.app1



Note that GraphicsMagick does not attempt to update any profile to reflect
changes made to the image, e.g., rotation from portrait to landscape
orientation, so it is possible that the preserved profile may contain invalid
data.
