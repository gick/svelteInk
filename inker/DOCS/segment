threshold>
segment an image
Segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color components and
identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means technique.
Segmentation is a very useful fast and and approximate color quantization
algorithm for scanned printed pages or scanned cartoons. It may also be used as
a special effect. Specify cluster threshold as the minimum percentage of total
pixels in a cluster before it is considered valid. For huge images containing
small detail, this may need to be a tiny fraction of a percent (e.g. 0.015) so
that important detail is not lost.Smoothing threshold eliminates noise in the
second derivative of the histogram. As the value is increased, you can expect a
smoother second derivative. The default is 1.5. Add the -verbose option to see a
dump of cluster statistics given the parameters used. The statistics may be used
as a guide to help fine tune the options.
