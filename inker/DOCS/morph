-morph <frames>
morphs an image sequence
Both the image pixels and size are linearly interpolated to give the appearance
of a meta-morphosis from one image to the next.
The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option. If the
-morphoption appears after all of the input images, all images are morphed.
