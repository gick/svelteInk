-chop <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>{%}
remove pixels from the interior of an image
Width and height give the number of columns and rows to remove, and x and y are
offsets that give the location of the leftmost column and topmost row to remove.

The x offset normally specifies the leftmost column to remove. If the -gravity
option is present with NorthEast, East,or SouthEastgravity, it gives the
distance leftward from the right edge of the image to the rightmost column to
remove. Similarly, the y offset normally specifies the topmost row to remove,
but if the -gravity option is present with SouthWest, South,or SouthEastgravity,
it specifies the distance upward from the bottom edge of the image to the bottom
row to remove.
The -chop option removes entire rows and columns, and moves the remaining corner
blocks leftward and upward to close the gaps.
