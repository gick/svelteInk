apply a Hald CLUT to the image
A Hald CLUT ("Color Look-Up Table") is a special square color image which
contains a look-up table for red, green, and blue. The size of the Hald CLUT
image is determined by its order. The width (and height) of a Hald CLUT is the
cube of the order. For example, a Hald CLUT of order 8 is 512x512 pixels
(262,144 colors) and of order 16 is 4096x4096 (16,777,216 colors). A special
CLUT is the identity CLUT which which causes no change to the input image. In
order to use the Hald CLUT, one takes an identity CLUT and adjusts its colors in
some way. The modified CLUT can then be used to transform any number of images
in an identical way.
GraphicsMagick contains a built-in identity CLUT generator via theIDENTITY
coder. For example reading from the file name IDENTITY:8 returns an identity
CLUT of order 8. Typical Hald CLUT identity images have an order of between 8
and 16. The default order for the IDENTITY CLUT generator is 8. Interpolation is
used so it is not usually necessary for CLUT images to be very large. The PNG
file format is ideal for storing Hald CLUT images because it compresses them
very well.
