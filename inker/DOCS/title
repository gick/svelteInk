-title <string>
assign title to displayed image [animate, display, montage]
Use this option to assign a specific title to the image. This is assigned to the
image window and is typically displayed in the window title bar. Optionally you
can include the image filename, type, width, height, Exif data, or other image
attribute by embedding special format characters described under the -format
option.
For example,

-title "%m:%f %wx%h"



produces an image title of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled bird.miff
and whose width is 512 and height is 480.
