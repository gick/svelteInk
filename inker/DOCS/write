-write <filename>
write the image to a file [display]
If filename already exists, you will be prompted as to whether it should be
overwritten.
By default, the image is written in the format that it was read in as. To
specify a particular image format, prefix filename with the image type and a
colon (e.g., ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (e.g.,
image.ps). Specify file as - for standard output. If file has the extension .Z
or .gz, the file size is compressed using compress or gziprespectively. Precede
the image file name with | to pipe to a system command.
Use -compress to specify the type of image compression.
