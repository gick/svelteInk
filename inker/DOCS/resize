-resize <width>x<height>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}
resize an image
This is an alias for the -geometry option and it behaves in the same manner. If
the -filter option precedes the -resizeoption, the specified filter is used.
There are some exceptions:
When used as a composite option, -resize conveys the preferred size of the
output image, while -geometry conveys the size and placement of the composite
image within the main image.
When used as a montage option, -resize conveys the preferred size of the
montage, while -geometry conveys information about the tiles.
