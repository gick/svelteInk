-flatten
flatten a sequence of images
In some file formats (e.g. Photoshop's PSD) complex images may be represented by
"layers" (independent images) which must be composited in order to obtain the
final rendition. The -flatten option accomplishes this composition. The sequence
of images is replaced by a single image created by compositing each image in
turn, while respecting composition operators and page offsets. While-flatten is
immediately useful for eliminating layers, it is also useful as a
general-purpose composition tool.
The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option. If the
-flatten option appears after all of the input images, all images are flattened.
Also see -mosaic which is similar to-flatten except that it adds a
suitably-sized canvas base image.
For example, this composites an image on top of a 640x400 transparent black
canvas image:

gm convert -size 640x300 xc:transparent \
-compose over -page +0-100 \
frame.png -flatten output.png



and this flattens a Photoshop PSD file:

gm convert input.psd -flatten output.png
