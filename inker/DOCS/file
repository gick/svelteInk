-file <filename>
write annotated difference image to file
If -file is specified, then an annotated difference image is generated and
written to the specified file. Pixels which differ between the reference and
compare images are modified from those in the compare image so that the changed
pixels become more obvious. Some images may require use of an alternative
highlight style (see-highlight-style) or highlight color (see -highlight-color)
before the changes are obvious.
