-ordered-dither <channeltype> <NxN>
ordered dither the image
The channel or channels specified in the channeltype argument are reduced to
binary, using an ordered dither method. The choices forchanneltype are All,
Intensity, Red,Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow,Black, and Opacity
When channeltype is "All", the color samples are dithered into a gray level and
then that gray level is stored in the three color channels. Separately, the
opacity channel is dithered into a bilevel opacity value which is stored in the
opacity channel.
When channeltype is "Intensity", only the color samples are dithered. When
channeltype is "opacity" or "matte", only the opacity channel is dithered. When
a color channel is specified, only that channel is dithered.
The choices for N are 2 through 7. The image is divided into NxN pixel tiles. In
each tile, some or all pixels are turned to white depending on their intensity.
For each N, (N**2)+1 levels of gray can be represented. For N == 2, 3, or 4, the
pixels are turned to white in an order that maximizes dispersion (i.e., reduces
granularity), while for N == 5, 6, and 7, they are turned to white in an order
that creates a roughly circular black blob in the middle of each tile. An
attractive "half-tone" looking image can be obtained by first rotating the image
45 degrees, performing a 5x5 ordered-dither operation, then rotating it back to
the original orientation and cropping to the original image dimensions. If the
original image is gamma-encoded, it is adviseable to convert it to linear
intensity first, e.g., with the "-gamma 0.45455" option.
