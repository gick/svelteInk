-comment <string>
annotate an image with a comment
Use this option to assign a specific comment to the image, when writing to an
image format that supports comments. You can include the image filename, type,
width, height, or other image attribute by embedding special format characters
listed under the -format option. The comment is not drawn on the image, but is
embedded in the image datastream via a "Comment" tag or similar mechanism. If
you want the comment to be visible on the image itself, use the -draw option
instead.
For example,

-comment "%m:%f %wx%h"



produces an image comment of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled
bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.
If the first character of string is @, the image comment is read from a file
titled by the remaining characters in the string.
If the -comment option appears multiple times, only the last comment is stored.
In PNG images, the comment is stored in a tEXt or zTXt chunk with the keyword
"comment".
