chroma subsampling factors
This option specifies the sampling factors to be used by the DPX, JPEG, MPEG, or
YUV encoders for chroma downsampling. The sampling factor must be specified
while reading the raw YUV format since it is not preserved in the file header.
Industry-standard video subsampling notation such as "4:2:2" may also be used to
specify the sampling factors. "4:2:2" is equivalent to a specification of "2x1"
The JPEG decoder obtains the original sampling factors (and quality settings)
when a JPEG file is read. To re-use the original sampling factors (and quality
setting) when JPEG is output, use the -define jpeg:preserve-settings flag.
