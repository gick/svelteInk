-crop <width>x<height>{+-}<x>{+-}<y>{%}
preferred size and location of the cropped image
See -geometry for details about the geometry specification.
The width and height give the size of the image that remains after cropping, and
x and y are offsets that give the location of the top left corner of the cropped
image with respect to the original image. To specify the amount to be removed,
use -shave instead.
If the x and y offsets are present, a single image is generated, consisting of
the pixels from the cropping region. The offsets specify the location of the
upper left corner of the cropping region measured downward and rightward with
respect to the upper left corner of the image. If the -gravity option is present
with NorthEast, East,or SouthEastgravity, it gives the distance leftward from
the right edge of the image to the right edge of the cropping region. Similarly,
if the -gravity option is present with SouthWest, South,or SouthEastgravity, the
distance is measured upward between the bottom edges.
If the x and y offsets are omitted, a set of tiles of the specified geometry,
covering the entire input image, is generated. The rightmost tiles and the
bottom tiles are smaller if the specified geometry extends beyond the dimensions
of the input image.
