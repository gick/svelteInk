-thumbnail <width>x<height>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}
resize an image (quickly)
The -thumbnail command resizes the image as quickly as possible, with more
concern for speed than resulting image quality. Regardless, resulting image
quality should be acceptable for many uses. It is primarily intended to be used
to generate smaller versions of the image, but may also be used to enlarge the
image. The-thumbnail geometry argument observes the same syntax and rules as it
does for -resize.
