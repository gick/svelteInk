-fill <color>
color to use when filling a graphic primitive
Colors are represented in GraphicsMagick in the same form used by SVG. Use "gm
convert -list color" to list named colors:

name               (named color)
#RGB               (hex numbers, 4 bits each)
#RRGGBB            (8 bits each)
#RRRGGGBBB         (12 bits each)
#RRRRGGGGBBBB      (16 bits each)
#RGBA              (4 bits each)
#RRGGBBAA          (8 bits each)
#RRRGGGBBBAAA      (12 bits each)
#RRRRGGGGBBBBAAAA  (16 bits each)
rgb(r,g,b)         (r,g,b are decimal numbers)
rgba(r,g,b,a)      (r,g,b,a are decimal numbers)



Enclose the color specification in quotation marks to prevent the "#" or the
parentheses from being interpreted by your shell.
For example,

gm convert -fill blue ...
gm convert -fill "#ddddff" ...
gm convert -fill "rgb(65000,65000,65535)" ...



The shorter forms are scaled up, if necessary by replication. For example, #3af,
#33aaff, and #3333aaaaffff are all equivalent.
See -draw for further details.
