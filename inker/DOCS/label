-label <name>
assign a label to an image
Use this option to assign a specific label to the image, when writing to an
image format that supports labels, such as TIFF, PNG, MIFF, or PostScript. You
can include the the image filename, type, width, height, or other image
attribute by embedding special format character. A label is not drawn on the
image, but is embedded in the image datastream via a "Label" tag or similar
mechanism. If you want the label to be visible on the image itself, use the
-draw option. See -comment for details.
For example,

-label "%m:%f %wx%h"



produces an image label of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titledbird.miff
and whose width is 512 and height is 480.
If the first character of string is @, the image label is read from a file
titled by the remaining characters in the string.
If the -label option appears multiple times, only the last label is stored.
In PNG images, the label is stored in a tEXt or zTXt chunk with the keyword
"label".
When converting to PostScript, use this option to specify a header string to
print above the image. Specify the label font with-font.
When creating a montage, by default the label associated with an image is
displayed with the corresponding tile in the montage. Use the+label option to
suppress this behavior.
