-orient <orientation>
Set the image orientation attribute
Sets the image orientation attribute. The image orientation attribute is
compatible with the TIFF orientation tag (and the EXIF orientation tag).
Accepted values are undefined, TopLeft,TopRight, BottomRight, BottomLeft,LeftTop
, RightTop, RightBottom,LeftBottom, and hyphenated versions thereof (e.g.
left-bottom). Please note that GraphicsMagick does not include an EXIF editor so
if an EXIF profile is written to the output image, the value in the EXIF profile
might not match the image. It is possible for an image file to indicate its
orientation in several different ways simultaneously.
