-deconstruct
break down an image sequence into constituent parts
This option compares each image with the next in a sequence and returns the
maximum bounding region of any pixel differences it discovers. This method can
undo a coalesced sequence returned by the-coalesce option, and is useful for
removing redundant information from a GIF or MNG animation.
The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option. If the
-deconstructoption appears after all of the input images, all images are
deconstructed.
