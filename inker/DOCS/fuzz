-fuzz <distance>{%}
colors within this Euclidean distance are considered equal
A number of algorithms search for a target color. By default the color must be
exact. Use this option to match colors that are close (in Euclidean distance) to
the target color in RGB 3D space. For example, if you want to automatically trim
the edges of an image with-trim but the image was scanned and the target
background color may differ by a small amount. This option can account for these
differences.
The distance can be in absolute intensity units or, by appending"%", as a
percentage of the maximum possible intensity (255, 65535, or 4294967295).
