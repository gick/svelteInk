-density <width>x<height>
horizontal and vertical resolution in pixels of the image
This option specifies the image resolution to store while encoding a raster
image or the canvas resolution while rendering (reading) vector formats such as
Postscript, PDF, WMF, and SVG into a raster image. Image resolution provides the
unit of measure to apply when rendering to an output device or raster image. The
default unit of measure is in dots per inch (DPI). The -units option may be used
to select dots per centimeter instead.
The default resolution is 72 dots per inch, which is equivalent to one point per
pixel (Macintosh and Postscript standard). Computer screens are normally 72 or
96 dots per inch while printers typically support 150, 300, 600, or 1200 dots
per inch. To determine the resolution of your display, use a ruler to measure
the width of your screen in inches, and divide by the number of horizontal
pixels (1024 on a 1024x768 display).
If the file format supports it, this option may be used to update the stored
image resolution. Note that Photoshop stores and obtains image resolution from a
proprietary embedded profile. If this profile is not stripped from the image,
then Photoshop will continue to treat the image using its former resolution,
ignoring the image resolution specified in the standard file header.
The density option is an attribute and does not alter the underlying raster
image. It may be used to adjust the rendered size for desktop publishing
purposes by adjusting the scale applied to the pixels. To resize the image so
that it is the same size at a different resolution, use the -resample option.
