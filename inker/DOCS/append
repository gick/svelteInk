-append
append a set of images
This option creates a single image where the images in the original set are
stacked top-to-bottom. If they are not of the same width, any narrow images will
be expanded to fit using the background color. Use +append to stack images
left-to-right. The set of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.
If the -appendoption appears after all of the input images, all images are
appended.
