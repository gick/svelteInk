-threshold <value>{%}
threshold the image
Modify the image such that any pixel sample with an intensity value greater than
the threshold is assigned the maximum intensity (white), or otherwise is
assigned the minimum intensity (black). If a percent prefix is applied, then the
threshold is a percentage of the available range.
To efficiently create a black and white image from a color image, use

gm convert -threshold 50% in.png out.png



The optimum threshold value depends on the nature of the image.
In order to threshold individual channels, use the -operatorsubcommand with it's
Threshold, Threshold-White, orThreshold-Black options.
