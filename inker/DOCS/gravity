-gravity <type>
direction primitive gravitates to when annotating the image.
Choices are: NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center, East, SouthWest, South,
SouthEast.
The direction you choose specifies where to position the text when annotating
the image. For example Center gravity forces the text to be centered within the
image. By default, the image gravity is NorthWest. See -draw for more details
about graphic primitives. Only the text primitive is affected by the -gravity
option.
The -gravity option is also used in concert with the -geometryoption and other
options that take <geometry> as a parameter, such as the -crop option. See
-geometry for details of how the-gravity option interacts with the<x> and <y>
parameters of a geometry specification.
When used as an option to composite, -gravitygives the direction that the image
gravitates within the composite.
When used as an option to montage, -gravity gives the direction that an image
gravitates within a tile. The default gravity is Centerfor this purpose.
