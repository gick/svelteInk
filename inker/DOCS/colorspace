-colorspace <value>
the type of colorspace
Choices are:CineonLog, CMYK, GRAY, HSL, HWB,OHTA, RGB, Rec601Luma, Rec709Luma,
Rec601YCbCr, Rec709YCbCr, Transparent, XYZ,YCbCr, YIQ, YPbPr, or YUV.
Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space. Empirical
evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ correspond
to perceptual color differences more closely than do distances in RGB space.
These color spaces may give better results when color reducing an image. Refer
to quantize [quantize.html] for more details.
Two gray colorspaces are supported. The Rec601Luma space is based on the
recommendations for legacy NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5). The Rec709Luma
space is based on the recommendations for HDTV (Rec. ITU-R BT.709-5) and is
suitable for use with computer graphics, and for contemporary CRT displays. The
GRAY colorspace currently selects the Rec601Lumacolorspace by default for
backwards compatibly reasons. This default may be re-considered in the future.
Two YCbCr colorspaces are supported. The Rec601YCbCr space is based on the
recommendations for legacy NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5). TheRec709CbCr space
is based on the recommendations for HDTV (Rec. ITU-R BT.709-5) and is suitable
for suitable for use with computer graphics, and for contemporary CRT displays.
The YCbCr colorspace specification is equivalent toRec601YCbCr.
The Transparent color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves the matte
channel of the image if it exists.
The -colors or -monochrome option, or saving to a file format which requires
color reduction, is required for this option to take effect.
