-interlace <type>
the type of interlacing scheme
Choices are: None, Line, Plane,or Partition. The default is None.
This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw image
formats such as RGB or YUV.
None means do not interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...),
Line uses scanline interlacing (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and
Plane uses plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).
Partitionis like plane except the different planes are saved to individual files
(e.g. image.R, image.G, and image.B).
Use Line to create an interlaced PNG or GIF orprogressive JPEG image.
