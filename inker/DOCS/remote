-remote
perform a X11 remote operation
The -remote command sends a command to a "gm display" or "gm animate" which is
already running. The only command recognized at this time is the name of an
image file to load. This capability is very useful to load new images without
needing to restart GraphicsMagick (e.g. for a slide-show or to use
GraphicsMagick as the display engine for a different GUI). Also see the
+progress option for a way to disable progress indication for a clean look while
loading new images.
