-scenes <value-value>
range of image scene numbers to read
Each image in the range is read with the filename followed by a period (.) and
the decimal scene number. You can change this behavior by embedding a %d, %0Nd,
%o, %0No, %x, or %0Nx printf format specification in the file name. For example,


gm montage -scenes 5-7 image.miff montage.miff



makes a montage of files image.miff.5, image.miff.6, and image.miff.7, and

gm animate -scenes 0-12 image%02d.miff



animates files image00.miff, image01.miff, through image12.miff.
