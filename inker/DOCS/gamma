-gamma <value>
level of gamma correction
The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look different
due to differences in the display monitor. Use gamma correction to adjust for
this color difference. Reasonable values extend from 0.8 to 2.3. Gamma less than
1.0 darkens the image and gamma greater than 1.0 lightens it. Large adjustments
to image gamma may result in the loss of some image information if the pixel
quantum size is only eight bits (quantum range 0 to 255).
You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels of the
image with a gamma value list delimited with slashes (e.g., 1.7/2.3/1.2).
Use +gamma valueto set the image gamma level without actually adjusting the
image pixels. This option is useful if the image is of a known gamma but not set
as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).
