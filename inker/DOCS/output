-output-directory <directory>
output files to directory
Use -output-directory to specify a directory under which to write the output
files. Normally mogrify overwrites the input files, but with this option the
output files may be written to a different directory tree so that the input
files are preserved. The algorithm used preserves all of the input path
specification in the output path so that the user-specified input path
(including any sub-directory part) is appended to the output path. If the input
file lacks an extension, then a suitable extension is automatically added to the
output file. The user is responsible for creating the output directory specified
as an argument, but subdirectories will be created as needed if the
-create-directories option is supplied. This option may be used to apply
transformations on files from one directory and write the transformed files to a
different directory. In conjunction with-create-directories, this option is
designed to support transforming whole directory trees of files provided that
the relative path of the input file is included as part the list of filenames.
