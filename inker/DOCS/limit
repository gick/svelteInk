-limit <type> <value>
Disk, File, Map, Memory, Pixels, Width, Height or Threads resource limit
By default, resource limits are estimated based on the available resources of
the system. The resource limits are Disk, maximum total disk space consumed;
File, maximum number of file descriptors allowed to be open at once; Map,
maximum total number of file bytes which may be memory mapped; Memory, maximum
total number of bytes of heap memory used for image storage;Pixels, maximum
absolute image size (per image); Width, maximum image pixels width; Height,
maximum image pixels height; and Threads, the maximum number of worker threads
to use per OpenMP thread team.
These resource limits are used to decide if (for a given image) the decoded
image ("pixel cache") should be stored in heap memory (RAM), in a memory-mapped
disk file, or in a disk file accessed via read/write I/O. The number of total
pixels in one image, and/or the width/height, may also be limited in order to
force the reading, or creation of images larger than the limit (in pixels) to
intentionally fail. The disk limit establishes an overall limit since using the
disk is the means of last resort. When the disk limit has been reached, no more
images may be read.
The value argument is an absolute value, but may have standard binary suffix
characters applied ('K', 'M', 'G', 'T', 'P', 'E') to apply a scaling to the
value (based on a multiplier of 1024). Any additional characters are ignored.
For example, '-limit Pixels 10MP' limits the maximum image size to 10 megapixels
and '-limit memory 32MB -limit map 64MB' limits memory and memory mapped files
to 32 megabytes and 64 megabytes respectively.
Resource limits may also be set using environment variables. The environment
variables MAGICK_LIMIT_DISK,MAGICK_LIMIT_FILES, MAGICK_LIMIT_MAP,
MAGICK_LIMIT_MEMORY, MAGICK_LIMIT_PIXELS,MAGICK_LIMIT_WIDTH, MAGICK_LIMIT_HEIGHT
,andOMP_NUM_THREADS may be used to set the limits for disk space, open files,
memory mapped size, heap memory, per-image pixels, image width, image height,
and threads respectively.
Use the option -list resource list the current limits.
