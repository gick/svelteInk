-verbose
print detailed information about the image
This information is printed: image scene number; image name; image size; the
image class (DirectClass or PseudoClass); the total number of unique colors; and
the number of seconds to read and transform the image. If the image is
DirectClass, the total number of unique colors is not displayed unless -verbose
is specified twice since it may take quite a long time to compute, particularly
for deep images. If the image is PseudoClass then its pixels are defined by
indexes into a colormap. If the image is DirectClass then each pixel includes a
complete and independent color specification.
If -colors is also specified, the total unique colors in the image and color
reduction error values are printed. Refer to quantize [quantize.html]for a
description of these values.
