-motion-blur <radius>{x<sigma>}{+angle}
Simulate motion blur
Simulate motion blur by convolving the image with a Gaussian operator of the
given radius and standard deviation (sigma). For reasonable results, radius
should be larger than sigma. If radius is zero, then a suitable radius is
automatically selected based on sigma. The angle specifies the angle that the
object is coming from (side which is blurred).
