-lat <width>x<height>{+-}<offset>{%}
perform local adaptive thresholding
Perform local adaptive thresholding using the specified width, height, and
offset. The offset is a distance in sample space from the mean, as an absolute
integer ranging from 0 to the maximum sample value or as a percentage. If the
percent option is supplied, then the offset is computed as a percentage of the
quantum range. It is strongly recommended to use the percent option so that
results are not sensitive to pixel quantum depth.
For example,

-colorspace gray -lat "10x10-5%"



will help clarify a scanned grayscale or color document, producing a bi-level
equivalent.
