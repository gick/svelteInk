-mask <filename>
Specify a clipping mask
The image read from the file is used as a clipping mask. It must have the same
dimensions as the image being masked.
If the mask image contains an opacity channel, the opacity of each pixel is used
to define the mask. Otherwise, the intensity (gray level) of each pixel is used.
Unmasked (black) pixels are modified while masked pixels (not black) are
protected from alteration.
Use +mask to remove the clipping mask.
It is not necessary to use -clip to activate the mask; -clipis implied by -mask.
