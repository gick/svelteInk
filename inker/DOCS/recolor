-recolor <matrix>
apply a color translation matrix to image channels
A user supplied color translation matrix (expressed as a text string) is used to
translate/blend the image channels based on weightings in a supplied matrix
which may be of order 3 (color channels only), 4 (color channels plus opacity),
or 5 (color channels plus opacity and offset). Values in the columns of the
matrix (red, green, blue, opacity) are used as multipliers with the existing
channel values and added together according to the rows of the matrix. Matrix
values are floating point and may be negative. The offset column (column 5) is
purely additive and is scaled such that 0.0 to 1.0 represents the maximum
quantum range (but values are not limited to this range). The math for the color
translation matrix is similar to that used by Adobe Flash except that the offset
is scaled to 1.0 (divide Flash offset by 255 for use with GraphicsMagick) so
that the results are independent of quantum depth.
An identity matrix exists for each matrix order which results in no change to
the image. The translation matrix should be based on an alteration of the
identity matrix.
Identity matrix of order 3

1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1



which may be formatted into a convenient matrix argument similar to (comma is
treated as white space):

-recolor "1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1"



Identity matrix of order 4

1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1



Identity matrix of order 5. The last row is required to exist for the purpose of
parsing, but is otherwise not used.

1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1



As an example, an image wrongly in BGR channel order may be converted to RGB
using this matrix (blue->red, red->blue):

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0



and an RGB image using standard Rec.709 primaries may be converted to grayscale
using this matrix of standard weighting factors:

0.2126 0.7152 0.0722
0.2126 0.7152 0.0722
0.2126 0.7152 0.0722



and contrast may be reduced by scaling down by 80% and adding a 10% offset:

0.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1
0.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 0.1
0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.1
0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.1
0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
