-resample <horizontal>x<vertical>
Resample image to specified horizontal and vertical resolution
Resize the image so that its rendered size remains the same as the original at
the specified target resolution. Either the current image resolution units or
the previously set with -units are used to interpret the argument. For example,
if a 300 DPI image renders at 3 inches by 2 inches on a 300 DPI device, when the
image has been resampled to 72 DPI, it will render at 3 inches by 2 inches on a
72 DPI device. Note that only a small number of image formats (e.g. JPEG, PNG,
and TIFF) are capable of storing the image resolution. For formats which do not
support an image resolution, the original resolution of the image must be
specified via -densityon the command line prior to specifying the resample
resolution.
Note that Photoshop stores and obtains image resolution from a proprietary
embedded profile. If this profile exists in the image, then Photoshop will
continue to treat the image using its former resolution, ignoring the image
resolution specified in the standard file header.
Some image formats (e.g. PNG) require use of metric or english units so even if
the original image used a particular unit system, if it is saved to a different
format prior to resampling, then it may be necessary to specify the desired
resolution units using -unitssince the original units may have been lost. In
other words, do not assume that the resolution units are restored if the image
has been saved to a file.
