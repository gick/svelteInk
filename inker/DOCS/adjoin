-adjoin
join images into a single multi-image file
By default, all images of an image sequence are stored in the same file.
However, some formats (e.g. JPEG) do not support storing more than one image per
file and only the first frame in an image sequence will be saved unless the
result is saved to separate files. Use+adjoin to force saving multiple frames to
multiple numbered files. If +adjoin is used, then the output filename must
include a printf style formatting specification for the numeric part of the
filename. For example,

image%02d.miff
