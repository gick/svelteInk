-antialias
remove pixel aliasing
By default antialiasing algorithms are used when drawing objects (e.g. lines) or
rendering vector formats (e.g. WMF and Postscript). Use +antialias to disable
use of antialiasing algorithms. Reasons to disable antialiasing include avoiding
increasing colors in the image, or improving rendering speed.
