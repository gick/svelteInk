pixel annotation style
Specifies the pixel difference annotation style used to draw attention to
changed pixels. May be one of Assign, Threshold,Tint, or XOR; where Assign
replaces the pixel with the highlight color (see -highlight-color), Threshold
replaces the pixel with black or white based on the difference in intensity,
Tint alpha tints the pixel with the highlight color, and XOR does an XOR between
the pixel and the highlight color.
