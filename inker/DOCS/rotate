-rotate <degrees>{<}{>}
rotate the image
Positive angles rotate the image in a clockwise direction while negative angles
rotate counter-clockwise.
Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds the height. < rotates the
image only if its width is less than the height. For example, if you specify
-rotate "-90>"and the image size is 480x640, the image is not rotated. However,
if the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees. If you use> or <, enclose
it in quotation marks to prevent it from being misinterpreted as a file
redirection.
Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with the color
defined as background (class backgroundColor). The color is specified using the
format described under the-fill option.
