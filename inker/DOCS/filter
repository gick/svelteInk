-filter <type>
use this type of filter when resizing an image
Use this option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see-geometry).
Choose from these filters (ordered by approximate increasing CPU time):

Point
Box
Triangle
Hermite
Hanning
Hamming
Blackman
Gaussian
Quadratic
Cubic
Catrom
Mitchell
Lanczos
Bessel
Sinc



The default filter is automatically selected to provide the best quality while
consuming a reasonable amount of time. The Mitchell filter is used if the image
supports a palette, supports a matte channel, or is being enlarged, otherwise
the Lanczos filter is used.
