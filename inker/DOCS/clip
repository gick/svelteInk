-clip
apply the clipping path, if one is present
If a clipping path is present, it will be applied to subsequent operations.
For example, if you type the following command:

gm convert -clip -negate cockatoo.tif negated.tif



only the pixels within the clipping path are negated.
The -clip feature requires the XML library. If the XML library is not present,
the option is ignored.
