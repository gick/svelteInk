-depth <value>
depth of the image
This is the number of bits of color to preserve in the image. Any value between
1 and QuantumDepth (build option) may be specified, although 8 or 16 are the
most common values. Use this option to specify the depth of raw images whose
depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change the depth of any image
after it has been read.
The depth option is applied to the pixels immediately so it may be used as a
form of simple compression by discarding the least significant bits. Reducing
the depth in advance may speed up color quantization, and help create smaller
file sizes when using a compression algorithm like LZW or ZIP.
