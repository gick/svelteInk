-unsharp <radius>{x<sigma>}{+<amount>}{
+<threshold>}
sharpen the image with an unsharp mask operator
The -unsharp option sharpens an image. The image is convolved with a Gaussian
operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma). For reasonable
results, radius should be larger than sigma. Use a radius of 0 to have the
method select a suitable radius.
The parameters are:
radiusThe radius of the Gaussian, in pixels, not counting the center pixel
(default 0).sigmaThe standard deviation of the Gaussian, in pixels (default
1.0).amountThe percentage of the difference between the original and the blur
image that is added back into the original (default 1.0).thresholdThe threshold,
as a fraction of MaxRGB, needed to apply the difference amount (default 0.05).
