-dither
apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image
The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial
resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels. Images
which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors can be improved with
this option.
The -colors or -monochrome option is required for this option to take effect.
Use +dither to turn off dithering and to render PostScript without text or
graphic aliasing. Disabling dithering often (but not always) leads to decreased
processing time.
