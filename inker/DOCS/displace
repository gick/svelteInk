-displace <horizontal scale>x<vertical
scale>
shift image pixels as defined by a displacement map
With this option, composite image is used as a displacement map. Black, within
the displacement map, is a maximum positive displacement. White is a maximum
negative displacement and middle gray is neutral. The displacement is scaled to
determine the pixel shift. By default, the displacement applies in both the
horizontal and vertical directions. However, if you specifymask, composite image
is the horizontal X displacement andmask the vertical Y displacement.
