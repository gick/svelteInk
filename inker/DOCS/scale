-scale <geometry>
scale the image.
See -geometry for details about the geometry specification. -scale uses a
simpler, faster algorithm, and it ignores the -filter selection if the -filter
option is present. Offsets, if present in the geometry string, are ignored, and
the -gravity option has no effect.
